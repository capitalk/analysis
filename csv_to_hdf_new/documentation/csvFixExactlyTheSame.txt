This script fixes all the bugs we mentioned about the raw csv files and outputs them in exactly the same format as before.
It still retains every message from the exchange. It is naive to write them in the file once more and not output only the correct
order books, but we wanted to follow this approach in order to comply with all the work that has been done previously and was 
based in this file format.

Execution
---------
python csvFixExactlyTheSame.py -i /home/elnio/Desktop/raw_august8/ -f FXCM_EURUSD_2012_08_08.csv -o /home/elnio/Desktop/fixedCSVs/
